# cider_utils

Modules written in C to accelerate CPU bound workloads on the Client-Side of Cider app.

*Assuming you know how to set up a C development environment.*

Usage:
`yarn` to build `index.node` which is the node facing module.
To access the module, import `index.js`, which will give you functions `parseFile` and `recursiveFolderSearch`.
